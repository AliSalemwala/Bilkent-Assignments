# Bilkent Assignments
This repository contains codes from all of the assignments I have completed over the duration of my Computer Engineering degree in Bilkent University. Some of the code is what I originally wrote for the homework, and some is new code I wrote for the purpose of this repository. I hope it serves future Bilkent plagiarists well, if they manage to find it :satisfied:.

As of now, it is not complete. But I am working on it.

# Note
I got an awesome job and realized this is unnecessary. I won't be investing more time into it, just adding the work I already have. Don't take what I've done as gospel. Hope it helps you, unnamed reader.
